## Authentication

Of the five data assurance principles in the [CIAAN model](https://securopia.wordpress.com/2011/08/25/security-models-cia-and-ciaan/), **authentication** is the one that directly involves users. Passwords are the most common authentication method. While the password method has serious problems, a better substitute has not yet emerged. PassKeys, also known as [WebAuthn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAuthn) may be the answer but they are not yet widespread. In the meantime, we need to use good password practice to secure our accounts.

Start with a good set of password guidelines. These are from a [Microsoft guide](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-and-use-strong-passwords-c5cebb49-8c53-4f5e-2bc4-fe357ca048eb):

* At least 12 characters, 14 or more is better.
* Not a word that can be found in a dictionary or the name of a person, character, product or organization.
* Significantly different from previous passwords.
* Don’t share the password with anyone; not even a friend or family member.
* Never send a password by email, instant message or other means that is not secure.
* Use a unique password for each site or service.
* Do not write your passwords on sticky notes or on anything that’s close to your computer or the thing being protected.
* Enable multifactor authentication whenever available.

Each of us has 25 to 50 or more different accounts. It's not reasonable or practical to create and memorize that many long and distinct passwords. Accordingly, you need some tools to help.

Contrary to common advice. I recommend using the password manager that's built into most web browsers. That manager will store your passwords and encrypt them using your computer's password as the key. Most will also create a backup of the information and share it with your other computers and phones. This means that you are trusting your browser manufacturer (Google, Apple, Microsoft, Firefox, etc.) to keep that information secure.

Whether you have considered it or not, you are already trusting that browser manufacturer. If they want to steal your passwords, read your social media posts, or monitor your behavior, their software has access to all of that information. Accordingly, my first recommendation is to be intentional in your choice of browser - on your computer, your tablet, and your phone. And use the same one in all places.

### Brandt's Password and Authentication Guidelines

* Choose your browser intentionally.
* Understand what an Incognito Window does and does not do.
* Choose a phone authenticator app intentionally.
* Use a browser password management feature or plug-in. Same brand as your authenticator app.
* Record passwords immediately when they are created.
* Keep your password record somewhere that certain trusted people can find it, and where untrusted people will not find it.
* Use fake, throwaway accounts whenever possible.
* Encrypt your hard drive – it’s built into Windows and MacOS but not always turned on.
* Watch for PassKeys – Nascent but maturing soon. The same browser-based password management and authenticator apps you use here will also work with PassKeys.

A phone authenticator app is used for two-factor authentication and it can also save the passwords for your phone apps so you don't forget them. Samsung and Apple have apps that come pre-installed but you can substitute alternatives from Microsoft, Google, LastPass and others.

Saving passwords in your browser or password manager is for convenient retrieval - because you can't remember 50 passwords. But your main Password Record should be independent and reliable. This may come as a surprise but I recommend a paper notebook - stored in a safe place. Overseas hackers can't access something on paper. Any time you create or change an important password, immediately record it in the notebook and destroy all other written copies. Make sure at least one family member you trust knows where the notebook is located. And don't share the location with family members you don't trust!

## Adversarial Mindset

Some common scams, like the [Nigerian Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam), are more than 200 years old. Others are new inventions. Regardless, scammers are constantly changing and inventing new tactics. So certain tell-tale signs like bad grammar and poor spelling may not be present.

Your best protection is to cultivate an **Adversarial Mindset**. That is, to think like your attacker. One good practice is to simply share stories about scams - both successful ones and failed attempts. If you get a fake message (and we all do), show it to friends and talk about it. **But don't forward scams** except to security agencies. You might accidentally victimize someone.

Here are some helps for thinking like an adversary and to recognize their messages:

**How do they contact you?**
* Phone
* Email
* Text

**What are they after?**
* Your Money
* Your Information
* YOur Credentials

**How do they motivate you?**
* Emotional Appeal
* Urgency

Websites, your bank, your doctor, even your travel agent will authenticate you before offering any service. In the same way, you should *authenticate* anyone who asks information of you. Before disclosing anything:

**Just ask**
* "How do I know you are from the IRS?"
* "What is your phone number so I can call you back?"

**Call them back**
* Use the organization's published phone number. **Not** the one in the message.

**Put them off**
* "I need to verify this first. Can I contact you tomorrow?"
